1.) A regular Latin verb has four principle parts. Specifically, the first principle part is the first person singular in the present active indicative, the second principle part is an infinitive, the third principle part is the first person singular in the perfect active indicative, and the fourth principle part is a participle.

2.) The first and third principle parts are finite verb forms. These principle parts both use first person singular.

3.) Both interficiō and faciō use the third conjugation, ĕre, as evidenced by looking at the second principle part. In both verbs, the ĕre ending is dropped, and iō is added for the first principle part, ī for the third principle part, and us for the fourth principle part. The third principle part of interficiō, specifically interfēcī, is identical to the third principle part of faciō, specifically fēcī. In the first principle part, interficiō uses an i, while faciō contains an a (specifically, ficiō compared to faciō). Similarly, in the second principle part, interficĕre also contains an i while facĕre uses an a (specifically, ficĕre compared to facĕre). Also, in the fourth principle part, interfectus uses an e while factus uses an a (specifically, fectus compared to factus).

4.) Audiō (to hear) and veniō (to come) belong to the fourth conjugation. Audiō follows a similar pattern for most regular verbs of the fourth conjugation (drop the -īre ending from the second principle part, -īvī for the third principle part, and -ītus for the fourth part). Veniō does not follow this pattern as it adds ī for the third principle part and us to the fourth principle part.

5.) Both capiō and faciō belong to the third conjugation as evidenced by the second principle part (capĕre and facĕre). In both verbs, the ĕre ending is dropped, and iō is added for the first principle part, ī for the third principle part, and us for the fourth principle part.
