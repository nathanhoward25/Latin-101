**+2 Excellent, but see comments below.**
1. What are the three genders of Latin nouns? - There are masculine, feminine, and neuter gramatical genders. These are arbitrary linguistic categories, not biological gender.
2. What are the three pieces of information in a Latin dictionary entry for a noun? - The first part tells you its nominative singular form, the second part is its genitive singular form, and the third part is its gender(s). This is usually abbreviated with m, f, or n.
3. How do you figure out what declension a noun belongs to? - You can figure out the declension of a noun by looking at the ending of its genitive singular. Specifically, the first declension ends in -ae, the second declension ends in -i, and the third declension ends in -is.
4. Like Latin, you can easily describe one noun with another noun in English (e.g., “the book’s title”, “the format of the assignment”). What case do you use in Latin to describe one noun with another noun? - The genitive case is used to describe one noun with another noun.
5. What case does Latin use to name the subject of a verb? - Latin uses the nominative case to name the subject of a verb.

Each of the following phrases comprises one noun in the nominative case described by a noun in the genitive case. Identify the gender, case and number of each noun.

1. amor (masculine nominative singular) Deianirae (feminine genitive singular)
2. deus (masculine nominative singular) amoris (masculine genitive singular)
3. amor (masculine nominative singular) deorum (masculine genitive plural)
4. Herculis (masculine genitive singular) canis (masculine or feminine nominative singular)
5. nomen (neuter nominative singular) dei (masculine genitive singular)
6. filii (masculine nominative plural) deorum (masculine genitive plural)
7. nomina (neuter nominative plural) filiorum (masculine genitive plural)

In English, "amor Deianirae" could translate into either "the love of Deianirae" or "Deianirae's love". **OK -- but what is the difference between these two in English?**
